    description: `🚀 Today's milestone felt big.

We've officially started migrating Rhythm from PWA to iOS, and our push notifications to the lock screen are working perfectly.

For ADHD users, notifications aren't just reminders. They are anchors for attention.

Each gentle nudge helps rebuild consistency, one small moment at a time.

Alongside that, we:

📊 Analysed Mixpanel and Clarity data to understand where users pause or engage deeply.

💬 Collected more positive feedback from early testers. The Reset feature and the RAIN method seem to be resonating well.

It is incredible how much you learn when you combine real user emotion, analytics, and product iteration.

Every small improvement counts when you are designing for neurodivergent minds.`,

Started beta testing and received feedback from our target users.
And it's been eye-opening.

From comments like:

"Your signup page is too much. I'll never sign up."
"Does this have an alarm or alert? I can't keep looking at the timer."
"I love the AI suggestions for breaking tasks, but they don't update when I change the description."

Every piece of feedback - the blunt, the curious, the thoughtful is gold.

It's helping us shape Rhythm into what it's meant to be:

a calm ADHD companion that truly understands the way ADHD minds move.

Next step: Simplify, listen more, and iterate faster.`,

    description: `🚀 Day 5 — Delta Residency: Building with empathy

Today was special.

We shipped MVP 1 of our ADHD app 🎉

And I had the chance to test it with real users at ADHD Koottuthaalam, India's first 'HackARThon' for the ADHD community, organised by TinkerHub Foundation, Flow Healthcare, and Oppam.

The event brought together artists, therapists, and neurodivergent individuals to explore creativity, tools, and inclusion.

It was humbling to watch people with ADHD try the app, share how they felt, and give open, honest feedback.

That feedback is already shaping the next version.

A huge thanks to TinkerHub for creating this space which helped me to connect deeply with the community and their lived experiences. 🙏

Every interaction reminded me that neurodivergent minds bring unique ways of thinking and creating.

Our goal is to design with that difference in mind and make technology more supportive, not restrictive. 💡

Day 5 was all about empathy in action.`,

Spent the day analyzing existing ADHD apps and habit-building tools.  
Key findings:  
• Most apps are too rigid for neurodivergent users  
• Need for more personalized approaches  
• Opportunity in gentle, supportive UX design
